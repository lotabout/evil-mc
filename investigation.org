* Things to store in fake cursor
** pointer
i.e. the position of the cursor: =(point)=
** mark
Actually, I am thinking that this is not needed for evil mode(see blow
for selection)
** state
i.e. current state of the cursor: normal/insert/visual.. etc.
** selection
According to function =evil-visual-store= in file =evil-commands.el=,
a visual selection contains the following information:

1. =evil-visual-direction=, the direction of Visual selection. 
2. =evil-visual-selection=, i.e. the type of selection
3. =evil-visual-mark=, the position of mark in Visual state, a marker.
4. =evil-visual-point=, the position of point in Visual state, a marker.

** Others
We can check =evil-vars.el= to check those vars that are related to
local state.

- =evil-state= :: the current evil state

visual mode:

- =evil-visual-beginning= :: the beginning of the visual selection, a marker.
- =evil-visual-end= :: the end of the visual selection, a marker.
- =evil-visual-point= :: the position of point in visual state, a
     marker.
- =evil-visual-mark= :: the position of mark in visual state, a marker.
- =evil-visual-selection= :: the kind of visual selection (selection type).
- =evil-visual-direction= :: wheter point follows mark in visual state.

and visual overlays if needed.

** Concerns
1. is =evil-repeat-ring= needed to be stored locally?

* Manipulation
Use =evil-visual-refresh= to update visual states.

* Problems
1. use =this-command-keys= fail to catch the macro register, such as
   "@q" and "q" is not catched.
2. Don't know when an operation is ended.
